            <p id="white"><strong>We are here to provide the answers to all of your questions.</strong></p>

            <p id="white">To begin with, a deposit for your desired property will cost approximately 5% to 20% of its total value.
            You will also have to consider hidden costs, including

            <ul id="white">
            <li>Survey costs</li>
            <li>Solicitor fees</li>
            <li>Removal costs</li>
            <li>Buildings insurance</li>
            <li>Initial furnishing and decorating costs</li>
            <li>Mortgage arrangement and valuation fees</li>
            </ul>

            <p id="white">It is also important that you can afford all of your monthly repayments as a first-time home buyer.

            onto the property ladder. Use our financial calculator to calculate how much you have to save and for how long to make sure you take this step at
            the right time.</p>
