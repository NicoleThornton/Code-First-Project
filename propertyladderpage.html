<h2>What is a Mortgage?</h2>
<p>A mortgage is a type of loan that is taken out with the specific purpose of buying property or land. Most last for the duration of 25 years but the term of the mortgage can be longer or shorter, depending on the type of mortgage you get.
Should you be unable to make you repayments, the lender can repossess your home and sell it to get their money back.</p>

<p>For this reason, it is crucial that you think about whether you can truly afford to keep up with your monthly repayments. You should also take into consideration the costs of owning a home, including household bills, council tax, insurance and maintenance.
As a result, lenders will want to see proof of your income and expenditure, and will also consider if you have any debts. This is to reassure the lender that should interest rates rise, you will be able to keep up repayments. They have the right to refuse to offer you a mortgage if they do not think that you can afford it.</p>

<h2>Finding A Mortgage</h2>
<p>You can apply for a mortgage, either directly from a bank or building society and can choose from their product range. There is a spectrum of different mortgage deals available. It is very important that you find the right one for you. With so much selection, this can be a difficult process, as it depends on various factors. If this is the case, you can turn to a mortgage broker or independent financial adviser who will compare different mortgages on the market for you.
 There are two main types of mortgages, including <b>Fixed Rate</b> and <b>Variable Rate</b> mortgages.</p>
<h4>Fixed Rate Mortgages:</h4>
<p>If you choose this option, the interest rate paid will remain the same throughout the length of the mortgage irrespective of whether interest rates change due to economic factors.</p>

<h4>Variable Rate Mortgages:</h4>
<p>With this option, the interest rates are subject to economic change and therefore, can change at any given time. As a result, it is important that you have some savings available, should the price of your mortgage increase.</p>

<h2>Applying for a Mortgage</h2>

<h4>Stage 1:</h4>
<p>This involves a basic fact find to determine how much you can afford and what type of mortgage is suitable for you. This will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking series of questions to determine what type of mortgage you want and how long you want it for</li>
<li>Finding out your financial situation to give an indication of how much a lender might be prepared to lend you</li>
<li>They will give you all the key information you need about the mortgage, their service and any fees or charges if applicable</li>
</ul>


<h4>Stage 2:</h4>
<p>This is when the mortgage lender will conduct a much more thorough affordability check and evidence of income.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is when you will begin your application</li>
<li>The lender/mortgage broker will begin a full ‘fact find’ and thorough affordability assessment</li>
<li>You will need to provide evidence of your income and expenditure</li>
<li>You may be asked questions about your finances and future plans that can impact your future income</li>
</ul>

<h2> Your Deposit</h2>
<p>When purchasing a property, you will have to pay a deposit which goes towards the cost of the property that you are buying. The more deposit you pay the lower your interest rates can be.
A deposit for your desired property will cost approximately 5% to 20% of its total value.</p>
