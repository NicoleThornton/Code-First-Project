Here are more tips on how you can improve your credit:

  <li> Pay your bills on time. Any defaults in payments, even as little as £5 stays on and damages your report for 6 years. Missing your last payment on an account will cost you about 130 points according to Experian. For budgeting tips, read our guide on how to budget
    <li> Add rent to your credit history. You can now ask for rental payments to be added to your Experian credit score to demonstrate that you are a reliable rent payer. You need to actively sign up to do this by paying rent through a company called Credit Ladder, which passes your money to your landlord or letting agent
      <li> Break up with your ex…financially. Break any links with ex-partners and former flatmates with whom you have shared joint accounts or joint bills.  Being financially tied to someone with a poor credit history , this will reflect negatively on yours.
        <li> If you have moved to the UK from abroad, get a copy of your credit record from the main agency in your home country. Contact Experian and let them know that you are willing to provide a copy of your credit history
          <li> Reduce your debts. Pay down any deby you have as much as possible before applying for a mortgage. For more tips on how you can put more money aside each month to pay off more debt, head over to our <a href= >budgeting tips</a> </li>
