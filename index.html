<h1>The Property Ladder.</h1>
<h2>Do you want to buy your own property? Do you know how a mortgage works?
Unsure of the financial and legal obligations?</h2>
<h3>We are here to provide the answers to all of your questions.</h3>

<p>To begin with, a deposit for your desired property will cost approximately 5% to 20% of its total value.
You will also have to consider hidden costs, including (but not limited to):</p>

<ul>
<li>Survey costs</li>
<li>Solicitor fees</li>
<li>Removal costs</li>
<li>Buildings insurance</li>
<li>Initial furnishing and decorating costs</li>
<li>Mortgage arrangement and valuation fees</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also important that you can afford all of your monthly repayments as a first-time home buyer.
If you cannot commit to these payments, then you have to consider whether you can actually afford to take your first step
onto the property ladder. Use our financial calculator to calculate how much you have to save and for how long to make sure you take this step at
the right time.</p>

<p>With our guidance, we will take you through each stage in detail, highlight the various home-buyer schemes that are
available and help you find a mortgage the right way! Click here to read more.</p>
